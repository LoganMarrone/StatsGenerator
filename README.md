# StatsGenerator
Simple Website that can be utilized for TTRPG games

Utilizing the React framework, this website is an easy way for Players and Campaign Runners to gain stats and health which is a hefty task.

This task requires a lot of dice rolls that can easily be done by my website. Including Health, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

You can even Swap stats and select custom stats if you are high enough level!

So far here is the first version that includes Multiclassing and ASI. Future versions may include options for Checks and even Spells.
